# Final Project Specification

## Benjamin Eavenson

For my final project, I plan to expand the card deck lab from earlier to create a games portal. I will go into further specifics of the three different pages that are required for my project.

## Page 1 - Main Portal

My first page will be a page that talks a little bit about the project and provides links to the two games that I will have coded.

## Page 2 - War

This page will allow the user to play a game of War against the computer. The user will be able to continue to play as many games as they want without having to refresh or navigate away from the page. The cards will be represented by the pictures used in the card deck lab. Users will be able to navigate back to the main portal from this page.

## Page 3 - Blackjack

This page will allow the user to play a game of Blackjack against the computer. The user will have 100 points to wager, and can choose how much they want to bet each round. When the user runs out of points, they will be given the option to reset back to 100. The user will be able to continue to play as many games as they want to without having to refresh or navigate away from the page. The cards will be represented by the pictures used in the card deck lab. Users will be able to navigate back to the main portal from this page.
