# Final Project Milestone 2

## Benjamin Eavenson

## Work Completed

* Temporary html for unfinished pages has been created.
* The page for War has been completed.
* CSS which can be repurposed for the unfinished pages has been written. More needs to be added to support styling Blackjack
* JS has been written for War.

## To Do

* Clean up the main page with some CSS
* Blackjack
* Put some separating comments in the CSS file to separate the css for each page*

*I have decided that it would be beneficial to use the same css file for each page, so as to keep the same styling for the heading, nav bar, and rules sheet for the game pages. Game components will not share names between the two games, so there shouldn't be any problem with duplicate style rules.
