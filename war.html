        <h2>War - Rules</h2>
        <p>The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards. The deck
        is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt
        one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places
        their stack of cards face down, in front of them. Each player turns up 
        a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes
        both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of their stack.
        If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card
        face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both
        piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each
        player places another card face down and turns another card face up.
        The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on. The game
        ends when one player has won all the cards.
