    <h2>Welcome to Ben's Cardroom</h2>
    <p>This is a project site to showcase what I have learned in CTEC126 - JavaScript.
        Below are links to two pages where I have built a couple of card games for you to try out - War and Blackjack.
        I chose War because I figured it would be a good place to start. The rules are simple compared to other card games, 
        so I really only needed to focus on how the cards present themselves. I chose Blackjack as the other game because
        it is one of my favorites, and also has simple rules compared to other card games. If you need to study up on the rules
        for either of these games, I provided them on the page for the game. I hope you enjoy my games!
